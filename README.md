Day 30 — CSS Positioning · Sticky Navbar

A clean, portfolio-ready demo that showcases CSS positioning: relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky — with a modern sticky navbar and responsive layout.

What this is

A simple project built for Day 30 of my web-dev practice series. It demonstrates practical positioning techniques through real UI components: a hero with an absolutely positioned profile card, a sticky navigation bar, a fixed contact CTA, and a sticky sidebar inside a two-column layout.

This is intentionally lightweight and production-friendly so you can drop it into a portfolio or extend it into a full case study.
